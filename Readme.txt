Requirements not executed
1.	Writing Test Cases 
2.	Logging
Reason: I never worked on writing test cases or logging from scratch. I always used existing setup. I tried setting it up, but, it didn’t work, I need to learn more on setting up test cases and logging.
Why I choose tools or libraries
1.	For Data processing and storing I have used Entity Framework and Entity In Memory, I found entity very handy for mapping data to objects, and using lambda expressions to play around with the data.
2.	For Interface, I’ve used ReactJS and Material UI. As a Backend developer, I never had a chance to work on UI, but I have started learning React and MUI recently, and this assignment gave me a good exposure for creating UI. React is very good for SPA like this, and MUI is very easy and quick to learn CSS Library for React components.
